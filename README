NAME
    File::ShareDir::Tarball - Deal transparently with shared files
    distributed as tarballs

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
        use File::ShareDir::Tarball ':ALL';

        # use exactly like File::ShareDir
        $dir = dist_dir('File-ShareDir');

DESCRIPTION
    If the shared files of a distribution are contained in a tarball (see
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball for why you would want to do
    that), automatically extract the archive in a temporary directory and
    return the path to that directory. In other words, from the consumer
    point of view, it'll behave just like File::ShareDir.

    NOTE: for now, only "dist_dir()" is supported. The other functions will
    soon come.
